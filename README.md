## Catify App! [This is my logo!](logo.png)

**[Catify]()** is a cat-lover app, which is based on a public API titled "The cat api", which allows a user to select a particular cat breed.

## What I used

- simple JS
- fetch/await/async 
- try and catch validation
- breed selector
- plain styles
- a responsive and user-friendly design
